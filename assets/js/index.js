// GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
// WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
// THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
// WHEN I enter my project title
// THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
// WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
// THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
// WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
// THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
// WHEN I enter my GitHub username
// THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
// WHEN I enter my email address
// THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
// WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
// THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

// This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributionsâ€”this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project
