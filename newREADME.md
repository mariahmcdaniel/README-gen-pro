  ## Usage

  To use this application you must have node.js as well as inquirer version 2.8.4 installed. To run the application, navigate to the root of the application's directory and run the command node index.js in the terminal. Next, take the time to answer all of the questions, adding relevant members of your team and their information. After you have completed this process for all team members and selected the  "my team is complete" option , your visual team roster will be generated for you. You will find it in the dist folder with the  name "team.html".


  ## Installation

  Please see node for instructions on installing node.js on your computer. To install inquirer, run the command npm i inquirer@8.2.4.
