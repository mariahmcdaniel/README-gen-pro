  ## Usage

  To use this application, you must have Git, Node.js and inquirer version 8.2.4 [installed](#installation). Once this has been done, run the command 
  
      node index.js 
  
  in the terminal while in the root directory of the application. You will then receive a series of prompts. After answering each of the questions, you will see the message 'Success! Your README has been generated' in the terminal and a README file with the name newREADME.md will be generated. From there, you may edit it to your liking, such as creating a visuals section if you'd like to provide visual elements to your document, and then you can save it for use in the application's directory that you created it for.


  ## Installation

  After insuring that you have [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/) installed, navigate to the root of the application in your terminal. Then, run the command

     npm i inquirer@8.2.4. 

  You're now ready to launch the application, to do this, run the command 'node script.js'.
